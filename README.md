# Iris-Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species using machine learning techniques. The famous Iris dataset is used for training and evaluating the model.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The features measured include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (if running the provided Jupyter notebook)
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
   cd iris-flower-classification

   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Results
Contains relevant information about the model's performance, accuracy, and any visualizations of the results.
